# workday-calender

This projects is a schedule tool for users to manage their workday (9am-5pm).
The daily calender allows users to input schedule items by hour and save them in local storage to be viewed later.
This current date and time is also displayed at the top of the page (refreshed when opened).
Another functionality that is still being tested is the color coding of the schedule based on whether items are currently in the past, 
due at the present hour, or still in the future.
